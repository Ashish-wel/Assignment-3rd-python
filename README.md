# Assignment-3rd-python Functions & Modules in Python

This repository contains solutions for Assignment 3.
Includes:
-Task 1: Factorial Calculation  using recursion. 
- Task 2 : Math module calculations ( square root, logarithm, sine).

# Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function
Problem Statement

Write a Python program that:

1. Defines a function named `factorial` that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using **recursion**.
2. Returns the calculated factorial.
3. Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.

-- Output --
Enter a number: 5
Factorial of 5 is: 120

#Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations
Problem Statement

Write a Python program that:

1. Asks the user for a number as input.
2. Uses the **math module** to calculate:
   
   - Square root of the number  
   - Natural logarithm (log base e) of the number  
   - Sine of the number (in radians)
      
3. Displays the calculated results.

-- output --
Enter a number: 25
Square root: 5.0
Logarithm: 3.2188758248682006
Sine: -0.13235175009777303
